The name `keepeco` derives from KeepassXC and [peco](https://github.com/peco/peco) because its first version was implemented as bash script using *keepassxc-cli* and *peco*. Now `keepeco` is rewritten in Go so it can run without any other tools.

## Features

- Filter entries with fuzzy finder
- Keep database password in system's keychain
